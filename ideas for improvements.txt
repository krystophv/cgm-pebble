Ideas:

have an update_proc function for every layer.
have the app/phone communication just set some global variables and then mark the appropriate layer dirty.
have the update_proc functions delegate any alerts/vibration stuff as it pertains to them.
have the JS cache things locally in localstorage.
have the watch not just send an empty ping, but instead the timestamp of the last received reading and then
	have the JS check to see if it's POSSIBLE for there to be a new reading, and send back cached data if
	there's not been enough time elapased for a new reading to be available
